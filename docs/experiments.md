## 2026-10-27 — C60/water reconsidered, shelved; finite-loading ethane/LTA opened

* C60/water (`docs/SPEC_c60_water.md`): the archived torch engine would need ~10 A100-days for the reference alone
  and the frozen protocol weeks in total; the conda env `envs/abffr` had been purged by scratch (631/690 OpenMM files
  gone). An OpenMM-CUDA port was started (`src/c60/omm.py`, unvalidated, branch `c60-openmm-wip`) and stopped when the
  user chose finite-loading LTA instead. Found while reading: `src/c60/dynamics.py` xi mode adds `+dV/dxi` as the
  driving force (sign error; that path never ran in production).
* Finite-loading ethane/LTA: design `docs/lta_loading/PREREGISTRATION.md`, engine `src/lta_loading/engine.py`,
  env `scripts/lta_loading/setup_env.sh` (`envs/ltafl`).
